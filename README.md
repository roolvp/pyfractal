# pyfractal
A script that draws simple fractals using Python Turtle. 

The aim is to build simple but beautiful fractals using Fibonacci proportions

Starting from 5 lines displayed , every layer adds 5 new lines using the end point of every line. 

The new lines are 1/phi times smaller than the previous lines.

Enjoy!
